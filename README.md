Current bugs: 
- Mobile styling incomplete
- Links do not work in blog posts
- Page is not rendering correct image in some cases

Todos:
- Better nav; categories should be a dropdown not separate links
- Limit and optimaize API calls, post detail makes excessive calls and runs two maps over the same data. Implementing Rich text should correct this
- About page
